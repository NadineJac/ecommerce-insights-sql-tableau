# Executive Summary

This project analyzes Magist’s performance as a potential partner for ENIAC’s expansion into Brazil.

**Main findings**:
- **Product fit**: Magist has limited focus on tech (10% of sales), low average prices (€106 vs. ENIAC €540), and very few high-end products (<1%).
- **Delivery performance**: Average delivery time of 10–12.5 days (within average range for Brazil), with 24% of tech orders delayed — below ENIAC’s service standards.
- **Market potential**: Brazil shows strong e-commerce growth and demand for accessories, but low Apple penetration (<10%), high import taxes (~38%), and logistics risks.

**Recommendation**:
- Do **not pursue a long-term partnership** with Magist.
- If testing the Brazilian market:
  - Use a **short-term, limited contract** focused on São Paulo region.
  - Restrict to **mid-priced accessories**, not high-end tech.
  - Explore **alternative partners and markets** with stronger Apple adoption and better logistics infrastructure.
